    "# Federated Learning MNIST Swarm Deployment\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates how to deploy a federated learning swarm for MNIST classification on the Manta platform.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What You'll Learn\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Setting up the connection** to the Manta platform\n",
    "2. **Defining modules and federated learning swarm** with workers, aggregator, and scheduler\n",
    "3. **Deploying the swarm** to a cluster\n",
    "4. **Monitoring results** from training and evaluation\n",
    "5. **Streaming logs** for debugging and tracking progress\n",
    "\n",
    "## Prerequisites\n",
    "\n",
    "Before running this notebook, ensure you have completed the following steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Create an Account\n",
    "- Visit [dashboard.manta-tech.io](https://dashboard.manta-tech.io) and create an account\n",
    "- Create a new cluster and start it\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Install Manta SDK\n",
    "Install the Manta SDK in your Python environment:\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "pip install manta-sdk\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Partition the Dataset\n",
    "Run the data preparation script to partition the MNIST dataset for multiple nodes:\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "python prepare_data.py -n <number_of_nodes>\n",
    "```\n",
    "This will create partitioned MNIST data in `temp/partitioned/node_0/`, `temp/partitioned/node_1/`, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Install and Configure Manta Nodes\n",
    "Install manta-node on each device that will participate in training:\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "pip install manta-node\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Download node configuration from the Manta dashboard (see \"Configure New Node\" button on your cluster page) and save it in `~/.manta/nodes/<node_name>.toml`\n",
    "\n",
    "**Important**: Configure each node's dataset path to point to its partition:\n",
    "- Node 0: dataset path = `/path/to/temp/partitioned/node_0/mnist.npz`\n",
    "- Node 1: dataset path = `/path/to/temp/partitioned/node_1/mnist.npz`\n",
    "- etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. Start Manta Nodes\n",
    "Launch each Manta node with its configuration:\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "manta node start <node_name>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Verify nodes are connected by checking your cluster dashboard or running:\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "manta node status\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6. Docker Image\n",
    "Ensure the Docker image `manta_light:pytorch` is available on your nodes, or modify the `image` variable in this notebook to use a different PyTorch-compatible image."
